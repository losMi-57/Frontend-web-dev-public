   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Salty, yummy, refreshing, and light. The dill adds an unexpected, amazing flavor. It's addicting! Lots of great protein in this one, with the eggs and salmon.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <h3>Dressing:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>¼ cup minced shallot</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Salad:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>1 head Bibb lettuce, leaves separated</li>
      <li>8 ounces cooked bacon, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>1 avocado, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>3 hard-boiled eggs, quartered and halved</li>
      <li>1 (3 ounce) package smoked salmon</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.</li>
      <li>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</li>
